## Overview

Quick Win Slot Machine Game is a simple slot machine game. The game incorporates Circle's solutions and especially aims users unfamiliar with Web3 technologies. Users will create a user-controlled wallet, fund it using a faucet, and make a deposit to Piggy Bank to initiate playing the game. Each spin costs them 0.5 USDCs and there are several winning conditions mentioned in the Instructions. The game uses Testnet USDCs, not real currencies (for now at least!).

Users should be able to:

- View game instructions for a general overview.
- Create user-controlled wallets.
- Fund wallets with Testnet USDC tokens using a faucet.
- Deposit USDC into the Piggy Bank to start playing. (Make a transaction to a developer-controlled wallet using their wallet address and PIN code)
- Check their balance within the Piggy Bank.
- Spin the wheel to play and win USDC tokens.
- Claim winnings by transferring USDC from the developer-controlled wallet back to their own wallet.

### Built with

- Typescript, ReactJS with Styled Components and React_Bootstrap for Frontend
- NodeJS and ExpressJS for Backend
- Circle's APIs
- Firestore

### Continued development

As a beginner in Web3 technologies, this project helped me improve my knowledge in web3 with a special focus on Circle's solutions. I gained insight about the Circle's Programmable Wallets and transaction between the wallets. I would like to improve game mechanics and integrate a Marketplace in which users can buy additional winning conditions or improved Piggy Bank models. I also aim to explore Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for future development.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You also need to have Circle and Firestore accounts. You have to create a .env file both for backend and frontend including information regarding these accounts.
