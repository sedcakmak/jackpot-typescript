        <br />
        <br />
        Each spin costs just <strong>0.5 USDC</strong>. Here's what you could
        win:
        <br />

        next to each other.
        <br />
        <strong>Close Call Prize (10 USDC):</strong> Two matching images that
        are next to each other.
        <br />
        <strong>Grand Prize (100 USDC):</strong> All three images match!
        <br />
        <br />
